=Installing the oltpbenchadmin=

The oltpbenchadmin's tool has two software components: (i)  oltpbenchmark-proxy is a proxy that interacts with the oltpbenchmark 
(ii) oltpbenchmark is a graphical interface to control the experiment's environment. 

==Installing oltpbenchadmin-proxy (the proxy)==

  # Download the file *oltpbenchadmin-proxy.zip*
  # Unzip the file *oltpbenchadmin-proxy.zip* preserving their directory structure
  # Open your terminal command line and enter the root directory of the unzipped file
  # Run the file *oltpbechmark-proxy.sh* to install the required components. To run the file *oltpbenchadmin-proxy.sh*, you must use the following command syntax `./oltpbenchmark-proxy.sh <root directory of the oltpbenchmark>`
    * Do not forget to check if the root directory of the oltpbenchmark has write permission and that the file *oltpbenchmark-proxy.sh* has execute permission

==Installing oltpbenchadmin (the graphical interface)==

  # Download the file *oltpbenchadmin.zip*
  # Unzip the file *oltpbenchadmin.zip* preserving their directory structure
  # Open your terminal command line and enter the root directory of the unzipped file
  # Use the command `java -jar oltpbenchmark.jar` to run the graphical interface of the oltpbenchadmin
